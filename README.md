## 📊 Project Details and Key Features
- Paste a YouTube URL and hit enter or Load Video and it should play instantly
- Opacity and Volume sliders to control the window independently from other Mac apps that are running
- It floats easily above all your other applications at a low opacity and blends into what you are doing so you can listen, and if you like also view a podcast to avoid clicking outside of any window you're working on, does not require signing in and will also allow you to click on the YouTube button and control the player when hovered over like normal...
- Runs as a Mac application so you don't have to deal with chrome extensions, but there's no top bar and show/hide controls are built in for closing, minimizing, and opening up in your default browser if you'd like 
- Snap buttons to snap to different corners of your screen easily without thinking easily while navigating around to move it out of what you're focusing on
- Move button for more accurate control to click and drag the window easily without worrying about clicking accurately right on the top bar 
- Enhanced detection of your cursor so you only have to be near the edge of the player to resize it to your liking, you don't have to be right on the edge of the player

**Standalone Floating YouTube Player for macOS**

A simple app for MacBook users (especially those with just one screen) that stays always on top — allowing you to listen to and view YouTube videos while working,
and easily adjust the volume, position, and opacity.

You don't need a Chrome extension, and it helps you stay focused by keeping your lo-fi music or podcast nearby — without taking up browser space or screen real estate if you're working on just your macbook with no external monitors and risking distractions.

## 🧩 Problems Solved (Without SIMBL, Afloat, or SIP)

### 🎬 1. YouTube Pop-Out Without Browser or Extensions

**Problem:**  
Browsers like Chrome/Safari don’t provide persistent or easily customizable floating video windows. Extensions help, but can't escape the browser sandbox or manage native window behaviors.

**✅ Solution:**  
A fully standalone Electron app that embeds YouTube videos in a pop-out window. No browser or extensions needed.

---

### 🌫️ 2. Adjustable Window Opacity on macOS

**Problem:**  
macOS doesn’t allow native window opacity control. Tools like SIMBL/Afloat require **disabling SIP**, which is a security risk — and they break on modern macOS versions.

**✅ Solution:**  
Uses `BrowserWindow.setOpacity()` in Electron — no system hacks, no SIP modification. Just smooth, adjustable transparency that works on Apple Silicon and latest macOS versions.

---

### 📌 3. Always-on-Top Floating Window

**Problem:**  
Built-in Picture-in-Picture features lack:

- Resizing flexibility  
- Easy repositioning  
- Transparency control  
- Combined control over pop-out, volume, opacity, and position

**✅ Solution:**  
This Electron app is always-on-top, resizable, draggable, and has snapping corners. It’s currently in testing to keep all controls seamless — and works as a distraction-free, standalone utility.

---

### ⚙️ 4. No Xcode or Apple Developer Account Needed (Yet)

**Problem:**  
Native macOS development typically requires:

- Xcode  
- A $99/year Apple Developer Account  
- App Store entitlements  
- Apple billing setup for users to download apps

**✅ Solution:**  
Built entirely with Electron (Node.js + JS) — no Apple tools or App Store required. You can run the app directly, even during a work session, without opening Chrome, managing billing, or signing in.

---

### 🛡️ 5. Fully Compatible & Future-Proof

**Problem:**  
Older tools like Afloat and SIMBL don’t work on modern systems (Sonoma, Sequoia, or Apple Silicon). Updates break support, and they were designed for Sonoma and backward compatibility not for macOS 15 (Sequoia) or upcoming macOS 16 (Tahoe).

**✅ Solution:**  
Electron is actively maintained, cross-platform, and **Apple Silicon compatible** out of the box. No system-level hacks. Just run and go.
